# A quiz represents a single unit of knowledge, the smallest element that can be taught and
# evaluated atomically. Breaking an area of study down to its component quizzes enables a
# subject to be taught in incremental steps.
#
# A quiz belongs to at least one category object, which denotes the topic or category of the
# content. If content is relevant to multiple disciplines, it may belong to multiple categories.
#    - (harmonics) are an element of (physics)
#    - (harmonics) are an element of (music)
#
# Each quiz may have one or more lessons and questions, to teach and evaluate the student
# on the relevant material.
#
# A quiz may depend on one or more other quizzes, and may have one or more other
# quizzes which depend on it. This dependency graph creates a system of prerequisites for
# quizzes.
